# Movies app Stage 2
I made this app from scratch for Android Developer Nanodegree program, this app is the second stage for the first project *Popular Movies App* and was  highly evaluated by certified Udacity code reviewer.

Is a movies app that communicates with the internet and provides a responsive user
experience, a fully featured application that looks and feels natural. In this project, I:
* Fetched data from the Internet with the MovieDB API. 
* Used adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views. 
* Incorporated libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write 
* Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
* Allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star).
* Create a database and content provider to store the names and IDs of the user's favorite movies
(and optionally, the rest of the information needed to display their favorites collection while
offline).
* Modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their
favorites collection.


## Features

With the app, you can:
* Discover the most popular, the most rated or the highest rated movies
* Save favorite movies locally to view them even when offline
* Watch trailers
* Read reviews

## Instructions

This app uses [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API to retrieve movies.
You must provide your own API key in order to build the app. When you get it, just paste it to: 
    ```
